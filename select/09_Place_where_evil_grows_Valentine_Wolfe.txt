Have you ever felt out of place?
Have you ever ended up
In a world you know is off limits?

We reach for what lies just beyond
The edge of tainted fingertips
Yearn for the blackness which comes
Past the edge of shadows

Where nothing ever quite makes sense
And all surrounding me is wrong
I can't believe it might be true
That I have finally found a home

So give me the bloodroot whose juice is red
I'll drink it down and lose myself
I'll partake of the monkshood and as I burn
All my doubts will drift away

If home is the place where evil grows
If home will tear your heart to pieces
When home wraps you tight in her poisonous blooms
Where else can I choose to be

In seeking something we are not
What type of madness will we find
And if the rot has settled in
What new creations then unlock

I twist the key and close my eyes
Afraid of what lies just beyond
But nothing good is ever cheap
Tonight I know I'll pay the price
